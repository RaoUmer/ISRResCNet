#### Abstract
> Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently achieved great success for single image super-resolution (SISR) task due to their powerful feature representation capabilities. The most recent deep learning based SISR methods focus on  designing deeper / wider models to learn the non-linear mapping between low-resolution (LR) inputs and high-resolution (HR) outputs. These existing SR methods do not take into account the image observation (physical) model and thus require a large number of network's trainable parameters with a great volume of training data. To address these issues, we propose a deep Iterative Super-Resolution Residual Convolutional Network (ISRResCNet) that exploits the powerful image regularization and large-scale optimization techniques by training the deep network in an iterative manner with a residual learning approach. Extensive experimental results on various super-resolution benchmarks demonstrate that our method with a few trainable parameters improves the results for different scaling factors in comparison with the state-of-art methods.

## Quick Test

This model can be run on arbitrary images with a Docker image hosted on Replicate: https://beta.replicate.ai/RaoUmer/ISRResCNet. Below are instructions for how to run the model without Docker:

#### Dependencies
- [Python 3.7](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) (version >= 3.0)
- [PyTorch >= 1.0](https://pytorch.org/) (CUDA version >= 8.0 if installing with CUDA.)
- Python packages:  `pip install numpy opencv-python`

#### Test models
1. Clone this github repository as the following commands: 
```
git clone https://github.com/RaoUmer/ISRResCNet
cd ISRResCNet
cd isrrescnet_code_demo
```
2. Place your own **low-resolution images** in the `./isrrescnet_code_demo/LR` folder. (There are two sample images i.e. set5_img_butterfly_x4 and urban100_img_092_x4). 
3. Run the test by the provided script `test_isrrescnet.py`.
```
python test_isrrescnet.py       
```
4. The SR results are in the `./isrrescnet_code_demo/sr_results` folder.
